# ESP32 Telegram Bot for Obstacle Detection using IR sensor

This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 microcontroller to detect obstacles using a sensor and send notifications to a Telegram chat using a Telegram bot.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, make sure you have the following:

- An ESP32 microcontroller board.
- A sensor connected to the ESP32 for obstacle detection.
- Access to a WiFi network.

## Getting Started

To install the Universal Arduino Telegram Bot library, follow these simple steps:

Download the library in the repository

In the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...

Select the library file you downloaded in step 1 and click Open.

That's it! The library is now installed and ready to use.

For more information about the Universal Arduino Telegram Bot Library, including usage instructions and examples, you can visit the GitHub page:  
https://github.com/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot
https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson

To install the ArduinoJson library, follow these steps:

In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.

In the Library Manager, search for "ArduinoJson".

Select the latest version available from the search results.

Click Install.

Once the installation is complete, you can start using the ArduinoJson library in your projects.

These libraries provide essential functionalities for communicating with Telegram bots and handling JSON data in your Arduino projects, making it easier to develop interactive and connected applications.

### Getting Chat ID in Telegram

To receive notifications from the ESP32 bot, you need to obtain the chat ID of your Telegram account. Follow these steps to get your chat ID:

1. Open the Telegram app on your mobile device or desktop.
2. Search for the "userinfobot" in Telegram and start a chat with it.
3. Type `/start` in the chat with "userinfobot".
4. The bot will reply with your chat ID. Copy the chat ID for later use.

### Creating a Telegram Bot using BotFather

To create a Telegram bot that will send notifications to your chat, you need to create a new bot using BotFather. Here's how:

1. Open the Telegram app and search for "BotFather".
2. Start a chat with BotFather and type `/start`.
3. Follow the prompts from BotFather to create a new bot:
   - Type `/newbot` to create a new bot.
   - Choose a name for your bot.
   - Choose a username for your bot.
4. BotFather will provide you with a bot token. Copy the token for later use.

### Setting Up the Code

1. Open the provided code in your favorite Arduino IDE.
2. Replace the placeholders with your WiFi network credentials, bot token, and chat ID.
   - Replace `"YOUR SSID"` with your WiFi network SSID.
   - Replace `"YOUR WIFI PASSWORD"` with your WiFi network password.
   - Replace `"YOUR BOT TOKEN"` with the token provided by BotFather.
   - Replace `"YOUR CHAT ID"` with the chat ID obtained from userinfobot.
3. Upload the code to your ESP32 board.

## Usage

Once the code is uploaded to your ESP32 board and the connections are set up properly:

- The ESP32 will monitor the sensor for obstacle detection.
- When an obstacle is detected, a notification will be sent to your Telegram chat.
- When the obstacle is removed, another notification will be sent to your Telegram chat.

Make sure your ESP32 is connected to the WiFi network for the notifications to work properly.
