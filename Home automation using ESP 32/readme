# ESP8266 IoT Smart Home System
@das-boot65
This project enables you to monitor temperature, humidity, and distance using an ESP8266 microcontroller along with various sensors. Additionally, it provides remote control over appliances via the Blynk app.

## Prerequisites

1. ESP8266 microcontroller board
2. DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
3. Ultrasonic distance sensor
4. 4-channel relay module
5. Access to a WiFi network

## Getting Started

1. Install Libraries: Install the required libraries using the Arduino IDE Library Manager (Blynk, DHT, and SimpleTimer).

2. Connections: Wire the sensors and relay module to your ESP8266 board as specified in the code.

3. Blynk Setup: Create a new project in the Blynk app and obtain the authentication token. Replace `BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN` in the code with your token.

4. WiFi Credentials: Update `ssid` and `pass` variables with your WiFi network name and password.

5. Upload Code: Upload the provided sketch to your ESP8266 board via the Arduino IDE.

6. Monitor and Control: Open the Serial Monitor to view sensor readings. Use the Blynk app to monitor data remotely and control connected appliances.

## Functionality

-Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: DHT11 sensor readings (temperature and humidity) are displayed on Blynk widgets (virtual pins V2 and V3).
  
-Distance Monitoring: Ultrasonic sensor measures distance, displayed on Blynk widget (virtual pin V0). Relay 1 is triggered if distance exceeds 30 cm.

- Remote Appliance Control: Relays 3 and 4 are controlled via Blynk switches (virtual pins V7 and V8).

- Temperature-Based Appliance Control: Relay 2 is controlled based on a temperature threshold set in the Blynk slider (virtual pin V5).

## Tips

- Ensure proper sensor connections and placement for accurate readings.
- Maintain a stable WiFi connection for seamless operation.
- Utilize the Serial Monitor for debug information and sensor readings during setup and testing.
