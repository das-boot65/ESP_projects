# ESP32 DHT11 Sensor Monitoring with SMS and Call Alerts

Welcome to the ESP32 DHT11 Sensor Monitoring project! This setup lets you keep an eye on temperature and humidity using an ESP32 and a DHT11 sensor. Plus, it can send you an SMS or make a call if things heat up too much.

## What You'll Need

Grab these essentials:

- ESP32 microcontroller board
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- Access to a WiFi network

## Getting Started

Here's the scoop on setting it all up:

1. Install the Libraries: Get the Blynk and DHT sensor libraries from the Arduino IDE Library Manager.

2. Connect Your ESP32: Plug it into your computer via USB.

3. Open Arduino IDE: Fire it up and create a new sketch.

4. Copy the Code: Grab the code from this repo and paste it into your sketch.

5. Update the Code: Fill in your WiFi details, Blynk auth token, and mobile number for alerts.

6. Upload and Run: Hit upload and let the magic happen!

## How It Works

Once it's all set:

- The ESP32 connects to your WiFi and starts monitoring temp and humidity with the DHT11.

- If it gets too hot (over 40Â°C), you'll get an SMS with "Fire in Factory" and a call to your mobile.

- Keep tabs on temp and humidity in real-time using the Blynk app.

## Handy Tips

- Check your ESP32's WiFi connection for SMS and call alerts to work.

- Make sure you've installed the Blynk and DHT sensor libraries to avoid any hiccups.
